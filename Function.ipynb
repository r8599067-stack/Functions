        "    -  A funciton is a block of reusable code using defined a def and lambda keyword\n",
        "    - it directly call by its name\n",
        "    - method is a also a function but is is associated with object or class\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "    - when we defining a funciton and pass some variable inside the parenthesis that is called as a position argument and when we call the function then it required to pass the paremeter inside the parenthesis\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "    - there are four way defining a function\n",

        "    - return statement is used to  return a value to the function and  it can be used fot  the further computation outside of the function\n",
        "    - return is a keyword in python\n",
        "    - once the return executed the function will be end immediately\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "    - iterator is an object and represent a stream of data return the value one by one\n",
        "    - there are two special method for iterator\n",

        "  iterable is used in data structure sequences and returing its member in one go\n",

        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "    - Normal function is used return statement but generator use yield stament\n",
        "    - yield statement is used to define a generator\n",
        "    - it is like a iterator returning element one by one\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "    - it consumes low memory and fast execution\n",
        "    - returning element one by one\n",

        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "    - map() is used to apply a function to each item of an iterable, returning the transformed results efficiently.\n",
